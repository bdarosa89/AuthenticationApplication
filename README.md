# AuthenticationApplication
The final for my Found. in App Dev course. A simple java authentication application for a zoo.
This basic application takes a user name and password, applies a MD5 hash to the password, and compares them to a credentials text file. 
Matched results return the employees role, allowing access to authorized files.
